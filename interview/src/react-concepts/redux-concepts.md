# Redux Concepts

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, often used with frameworks like React. It helps you manage the state of your application in a predictable manner, making it easier to understand, debug, and test. Below are the core concepts of Redux:

## 1. Store

- **Definition**: The **store** is where the entire state of the application is kept. There is **only one store** in a Redux-based app. The store holds the state and provides methods to interact with it.
- **Key Points**:
  - The state in the store is **immutable**. You cannot modify it directly.
  - You interact with the store by **dispatching actions** or subscribing to **state changes**.

## 2. Actions

- **Definition**: **Actions** are plain JavaScript objects that represent an event or an intention to change the state in the store. Actions must have a `type` property that describes the action being performed.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Action Creators**: These are functions that create and return action objects.
  - Actions are dispatched to tell the store **what happened**, but not how the state should change.

#### Example Action:

```javascript
// Action
const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';

const addTodo = (todo) => ({
  type: ADD_TODO,
  payload: todo
});
```

## 3. Reducers

- **Definition**: **Reducers** are pure functions that specify **how the state should change** in response to an action. They take the current state and the action as arguments and return a new state.
- **Key Points**:
  - Reducers are **pure** functions, meaning they don’t mutate the state directly and don’t produce side effects.
  - Reducers should return a new object for updated state.
  - You can combine multiple reducers to manage different parts of the state using `combineReducers`.

#### Example Reducer:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  todos: []
};

const todoReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

## 4. Dispatch

- **Definition**: `dispatch` is the method used to send an **action** to the store. This method triggers the reducer to process the action and update the state accordingly.
- **Key Points**:
  - `dispatch` sends an action to the Redux store.
  - It’s the **only way** to interact with the store and update the state.

#### Example of Dispatching an Action:

```javascript
store.dispatch(addTodo({ text: 'Learn Redux' }));
```

## 5. State

- **Definition**: The **state** in Redux is the **single source of truth** for the entire application. The state is immutable, and to update the state, you must dispatch actions and have the reducers handle them.
- **Key Points**:
  - The state is typically a plain JavaScript object, but it can also be more complex.
  - The state structure is determined by the reducers, which can manage different slices of the state.

## 6. Selectors

- **Definition**: **Selectors** are functions that select or compute a piece of state. They help keep the state management logic **separated** from the component logic.
- **Key Points**:
  - Selectors are often used in combination with the `useSelector` hook (in React-Redux) to get values from the Redux store.
  - They can be used to **memoize** results to optimize performance using libraries like `reselect`.

#### Example Selector:

```javascript
const getTodos = (state) => state.todos;
```

## 7. Store Subscription

- **Definition**: Subscribing to the store means listening to the state changes. When the state changes, the subscribed component or function will be notified to re-render or take action.
- **Key Points**:
  - In React, this is typically done via the `useSelector` hook (in functional components) or `connect` (in class components).
  - This allows components to react to state updates and only re-render when necessary.

## 8. Middleware

- **Definition**: **Middleware** in Redux provides a way to extend Redux’s capabilities. Middleware allows you to intercept and modify the dispatched actions before they reach the reducer.
- **Key Points**:
  - Middleware can be used for logging, performing side effects, handling async actions, etc.
  - Popular middleware includes `redux-thunk` (for async logic) and `redux-saga` (for managing side effects).
  
#### Example of Middleware Usage:

```javascript
const loggerMiddleware = store => next => action => {
  console.log('Dispatching action:', action);
  return next(action);
};
```

## 9. Thunk Middleware (redux-thunk)

- **Definition**: Thunk middleware allows action creators to return either a **function** (a thunk) or an **action object**. This is especially useful for **asynchronous operations** like making HTTP requests.
- **Key Points**:
  - The returned function can be used to **dispatch multiple actions** or perform async logic before dispatching an action.

#### Example with Thunk:

```javascript
const fetchTodos = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    fetch('/todos')
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((todos) => {
        dispatch({ type: 'SET_TODOS', payload: todos });
      });
  };
};
```

## Redux Flow Overview:

1. **Action Creation**: An event (e.g., a user click) triggers an action.
2. **Dispatch Action**: The action is dispatched using `store.dispatch()`.
3. **Reducer Handling**: The reducer processes the action and returns a new state.
4. **State Update**: The store updates its state based on the action.
5. **Re-render**: Components that are subscribed to the state will re-render with the new data.

## Why Use Redux?

- **Centralized State**: It provides a **single source of truth** for your application’s state.
- **Predictable**: With a clear flow of data, it’s easy to debug and trace state changes.
- **Maintainability**: Redux helps in organizing complex state logic in large applications.
- **Easy Testing**: Reducers and actions are pure functions, making them easy to test.

## When to Use Redux?

Redux is particularly useful when:
- Your app has complex state logic (e.g., multiple components need to share the same data).
- Your app needs to manage global state (e.g., authentication status, settings, etc.).
- You want to perform side effects or handle asynchronous actions in a predictable manner.
