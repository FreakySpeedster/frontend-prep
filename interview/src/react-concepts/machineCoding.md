Here are 10 React.js LLD questions you should definitely prepare for to make a switch to top PBCs:

𝟭. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗮 𝘁𝗼𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗶𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁?
 → How will you manage global state, queue notifications, and prevent overlaps? Would you use Context, Redux, or a custom event bus?

𝟮. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝘁?
 → How will you structure recursive components and optimize performance?
 "I’d structure a recursive <Comment /> component that renders each comment and its children. To optimize performance, I’d memoize each comment with React.memo(), use local state for collapse/expand to avoid unnecessary rerenders, and ensure stable keys. For very large threads, I’d consider virtualization or pagination of comment trees."

𝟯. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗯𝗮𝗿 𝗻𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻?
 → What’s your approach for mobile vs desktop, toggling submenus, and linking routes?
 "I’d design a sidebar that’s fixed on desktop but off-canvas on mobile, toggled via a hamburger menu. I’d use local state for submenus to keep each section isolated and performant. Routing would be handled by <NavLink> so I get active link styling out of the box. For accessibility, I’d use ARIA attributes and ensure keyboard navigation works. Finally, I’d add transitions for smooth opening and closing."

𝟰. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮 𝘁𝗮𝗯 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀?
 → How do you manage tab state, dynamic rendering, and apply smooth transitions?

𝟱. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲, 𝘀𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁?
 → How do you modularize headers, handle pagination, and manage large datasets?

𝟲. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮 '𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲' 𝗯𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝘂𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀?
 → How do you update the UI instantly and handle rollbacks on failure?

𝟳. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁?
 → Would you use WebSockets or polling? How do you manage messages and typing indicators?

𝟴. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗺?
 → Would you use lodash? Or write custom logic?

𝟵. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗽𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁?
 → Will you allow multiple sections to open? How will you manage transitions?

𝟭𝟬. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗸/𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗮𝗽𝗽?
 → Would you use CSS variables, Context API, or a library?
